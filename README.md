## Analysis 

The old code/loop selects the next ticker and then starts its search from the beginning of the row (not from the beginning of the row where its ticker starts). Refactored by adding a variable. The variable jumps to the exact row of the start of the next ticker rather than starting from the top. 

In the year 2017, all tickers had positive returns except TERP. In 2018, all tickers were negative returns except for ENPH and RUN
  Although 2018 had a poor year in returns, it still had an increase of $ 1,393,99,100 of total daily volume than 2017.
